%% INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPILING THIS DOCUMENT ("CV.tex")
%% TEX ---(XeLaTeX)---> PDF:
%%
%% Method 1: Use latexmk for fully automated document generation:
%%   latexmk -xelatex "CV.tex"
%%   (add the -pvc switch to automatically recompile on changes)
%%
%% Method 2: Use XeLaTeX directly:
%%   xelatex "CV.tex"
%%   (run multiple times to resolve cross-references if needed)
